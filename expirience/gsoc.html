									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<h3>Eclipse and SWT</h3>
									<p>Eclipse is the world's most widely used Java IDE. It is amongst the largest open source organisations and hosts a large scale of projects in different fields that can be based on Java. It also owns an entire open sourced java widget library, named SWT (aka. Standad Widget Library), on which the IDE is built. The library is has it's APIs similar to Javascript, and is powerful and fast as it relies on the underlying OS for drawing the widgets, while java handles the widget actions. For the promotion of the widget library, Eclipse hosts all of it's science projects using SWT, and most of the projects are solely for the purpose of of the promotion of SWT. SWT widgets, tough the fastest among the Java widgets, is still not the most widely used widget library due to lack of awareness.</p>
									<h3>Eclipse and Open Source</h3>
									<p>Eclipse, as is the world's most widely used IDE, it faces much of rivalry from other IDEs. To keep an edge above the others, Eclipse does not keep all of it's code entirely open source. Instead, only the promotion projects of SWT are the repositories entirely on Github. The IDE application and the SWT library are not available on Github (an outdated version is just put up tough on Github).</p>
									<h3>Eclipse SWTChart</h3>
									<p>Eclipse SWTChart is a subproject of EAVP(aka. Eclipse Advanced Visualisation Project), which is just anathor project for promotion of SWT. It is a charting library and is the central charting repository for all of Eclipse Science Projects. It conatins Line charts, Bar charts, Scatter charts, and  recently Pie charts.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Initial contributions</h2>
									<p>I first started studying the SWTChart repository in January 2020 towards the end. By February 2020, I had understood the entire source code. I opened various PRs initially removing redundant cases and code. The Pie Charts then were only a suggestion to be implemented in an otherwise cartesian charting library. I took it up as one month part of my three months GSoC proposal to implement the Pie Charts. To prove I was capable, I implemented a small and simple version of what I had promised in my proposal and kept the major as a part of my GSoC.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Interactions with mentor and Building Proposal</h2>
									<p>Before everything else, I did not know how to run Eclipse RCP appplications, so I sought help from my mentor. He helped willingly. After deciding that Pie Charts were not merely enough for GSoC, I asked my mentor for what else I could implement. As it was still February, he asked me if I was willing to learn more technologies and contribute to a large repo or contribute to smaller repos. Unwilling to go against the mentor, I agreed for learning technologies. Across the next 15 days, I learnt GTK, Cocoa, Cario, Win32. These are Desktop application widgets of different OS. He then made me a member of Eclipse, and allowed me into the Eclipse Workspace. I worked on SWT and studied what all goes behind the hood of the widget library, how it abstracts the underlying OS. He assigned me a minor issue in the SWT library and asked me to work on it for my GSoC. I had come too far to revert back, nad I agreed.</p>
									<p>I finally prepared my proposal stating how I plan to solve the issue in SWT, and what all I will implement in my Pie-Charts. The timeline I had proposed was two months for SWT, one for the Pie Chart in SWTChart. My mentor asked me to relax the timeline and work as per my convinience.</p>
									<p>That was not all. After the submission of the proposal, my competitors tried completing my proposal on the Pie Charts to make my proposal weak. I tried completing parts of their proposal too to shut them up.(Peace is keeping a larger stick than the other guy:) ).</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Getting selected and Bonding period</h2>
									<p>My mentor had informed me beforehand that I was about to be selected. The results were out and I was selected. It was pretty cool.</p>
									<p> During the bonding period, I worked in the same workspace as Lars Vogella (he hosts amongst the top tutorials on Java technologies on the internet)!!. I came in touch with many people from other orgs, like Aleksndar Kurtakov from Redhat and many others from GNOME.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>GSoC work</h2>
									<p>I had already started my work in proposal about one month ago when my mentor had informed me about my selection. I along the same lines also completed my proposal one month before the end of the GSoC. I exceded what was proposed for GSoC in the SWTChart Project. In the SWT library, I learnt quite a lot about Operating Systems and had hands on expirience with locking widgets through mutextes and their interactions due to user events. I learnt and delt with the many layers of state masks that are used to keep the state information of the widget, thus abstrcting the locks on the mutexes.</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Post GSoC</h2>
									<p>After GSoC, I put my focus on aquiring an internship on-campus, (which I did not get until December), but I did eventually get in Juspay.</p>
